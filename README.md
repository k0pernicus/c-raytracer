# c-raytracer

A raytracer exercise in C (C 11)... just for fun.  
I only used the C standard library for this exercise.

Based on [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

## Build

```bash
make release # or debug if you want debug symbols in the bin
./raytracer
```

This repository includes my vscode configuration, if you want to play / debug the program by yourself.

## Visualisation

The output is a PPM file - to see the content, please to install a PPM viewer (like ImageMagick).

```bash
# To display the output image using imagemagick
display output.ppm
```
